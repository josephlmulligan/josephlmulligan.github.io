I am currently a PhD student at Imperial College London, jointly supported by the Oxford & Imperial [Centre for Doctoral Training in the Mathematics of Random Systems](https://www.randomsystems-cdt.ac.uk/) and [Qube Research & Technologies](https://www.qube-rt.com/). My supervisors are [Antoine Jacquier](https://jackantoinejacquie.wixsite.com/jacquier) and [Johannes Muhle-Karbe](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~jmuhleka/). My research is focused on algorithmic trading and portfolio management.
